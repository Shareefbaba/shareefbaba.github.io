<img src="/images/two_bar_link.png" alt="Two-Bar Arm CAD" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom:1rem;">

A ROS2-based robotic simulation project showcasing mechanical design, path planning, and motion execution.

---

### ðŸ”§ What Was Done?
- Designed a two-link robotic arm in SolidWorks, converted it to a URDF model, and performed path planning using MoveIt2 and RViz2.
- Modeled all parts in SolidWorks and exported them to URDF using a URDF exporter.
- Configured SRDF, kinematics, planning groups, and controllers using MoveIt2 Setup Assistant.

---

### ðŸ§  How It Was Achieved?
- Created a complete MoveIt2 configuration package with launch and RViz2 files.
- Used RViz2 for visualization and simulation of path planning.
- Applied joint-space motion planning and trajectory execution with live feedback.

---

### âœ… Outcome
- Successfully demonstrated joint-space motion simulation using MoveIt2.
- Validated motion planning pipeline for potential integration in real autonomous systems.
