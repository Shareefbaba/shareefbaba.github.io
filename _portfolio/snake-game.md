## 🐍 Snake Game using Python & Pygame

<img src="/images/snake_game_preview.png" alt="Snake Game Preview" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom:1rem;">

A classic Snake Game developed using Python and the Pygame library to demonstrate foundational programming logic, real-time game control, and interactive GUI development.

### 💡 What Was Done?
- Built a playable Snake Game with core game mechanics: snake movement, food consumption, self-collision, and wall collision.
- Designed game logic using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
- Used the Pygame library to render graphics, handle user input, and manage real-time gameplay.
- Added pause and restart functionality with score tracking.

### 🧠 How It Works?
- The `Snake` and `Apple` are defined as classes with independent movement and rendering.
- Collision detection is implemented between the snake and apple, snake body, and game window borders.
- Pygame is used for rendering sprites and capturing keyboard inputs (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ESC`, `P`, `ENTER`).
- The game resets on collision or allows resuming with pause functionality.

### ✅ Outcome
- Created a fully working desktop game using Python and Pygame.
- Gained hands-on experience with event loops, 2D rendering, and game logic.
- Useful as a starter project for game development and Python OOP practice.
