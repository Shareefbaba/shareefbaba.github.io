## üõ†Ô∏è Ongoing Project ‚Äì ROS2-Based Autonomous Inspection Robot

<img src="/images/servilance.png" alt="Ongoing Robot Project" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom:1rem;">

This project focuses on building a ROS2-based autonomous robot for indoor inspection, navigation, and real-time mapping.

### üîß Current Work Includes:
- Building a URDF model of the 4-wheeled robot
- Integrating RPlidar and Intel RealSense camera
- Testing SLAM Toolbox for indoor mapping
- Designing a custom RViz2 interface for monitoring

### üéØ Goal
To develop a fully autonomous robot capable of navigating hallways and inspecting equipment using sensor fusion and ROS2 Nav2 stack.
