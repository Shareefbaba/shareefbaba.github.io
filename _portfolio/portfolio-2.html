title: "Robot Operating System, MoveIt2 & Gazebo Simulation"
excerpt: "A collection of projects involving ROS2-based robotic control, motion planning using MoveIt2, and simulation in Gazebo. These works showcase my skills in building, controlling, and simulating intelligent robotic systems using real-time data, custom URDF models, and autonomous task execution.<br/><img src='/images/cad_design.jpg'>"
