This project demonstrates a simulation of a mobile base robot equipped with a 2-DOF robotic arm in a Gazebo environment. The robot is capable of navigating in a simulated world and executing arm motions via RViz2.

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
- SolidWorks  
- Gazebo Classic / Ignition  
- ROS2 (Nav2 stack)  
- RViz2  
- URDF / XACRO  
- Python launch files  

### ðŸ§  Project Highlights
- **Robot Design & Modeling**: Designed mobile base and 2-axis arm in SolidWorks. Exported parts as STL and integrated using URDF/XACRO.  
- **Gazebo Simulation**: Launched robot in Gazebo with sensors, terrain, and physics.  
- **Sensor & Nav2 Stack**: Integrated LIDAR + cameras with Nav2 stack for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.  
- **RViz2 Visualization**: Visualized robot control and joint movements using RViz2.

### âœ… Outcome
- Built strong foundation in manipulation + navigation.  
- Working control loop using sensors, ROS2, and simulation.
