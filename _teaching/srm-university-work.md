As a Project Engineer in the field of mechanical and robotics system development, I have been actively contributing to end-to-end robotic system design and integration. This role involves a fusion of mechanical design, motion analysis, robotics simulation, and real-time perception integration.

ðŸ”§ Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
Led project planning, scheduling, and procurement, ensuring efficient resource allocation and timely execution.

Created detailed conceptual and functional designs using SolidWorks, followed by motion analysis in MSC ADAMS to validate kinematics and dynamics.

Implemented path planning algorithms and simulated motion using ROS 2, MoveIt 2, and RViz, enabling accurate robotic arm trajectory control.

Integrated 3D spatial awareness systems using:

Open3D, OpenCV for point cloud and image processing

Livox Mid-70 LiDAR and ZED 2i stereo camera for perception and mapping

Oversaw mechanical system fabrication, including motor selection, drive control architecture, and integration into the robotic arm platform.

Coordinated with cross-disciplinary teams to prototype, test, and iterate on design improvements.
