## 🚗 Project Overview

This project involved designing a robotic manipulator mounted on a vehicle. The main goal was to develop a complete workflow — from mechanical design to motion planning and visualization using MoveIt2 and RViz2.

---

## 📌 Key Highlights

- 🧩 **Modeling in SolidWorks**  
  Created a 3D model of a two-bar linkage robotic arm including joints, links, and mounting base.

- 🔄 **URDF + SRDF Setup**  
  Converted the SolidWorks design to URDF format using an exporter. Created an SRDF file with joint groups and planning configuration.

- ⚙️ **MoveIt2 Integration**  
  Used MoveIt Setup Assistant to generate a planning pipeline, added controllers, and configured the robot’s kinematics.

- 🧠 **Path Planning in RViz2**  
  Launched the robot in RViz2, used MoveIt2 plugins to test path planning, execute trajectories, and visualize motion feedback in real-time.

## 🎯 Outcome

- Successfully simulated joint-space motion planning.
- Verified reachability and motion smoothness in RViz2.
- Built a base for future real-world implementation and robot control.
