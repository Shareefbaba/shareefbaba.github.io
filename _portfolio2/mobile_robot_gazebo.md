## 📌 Key Highlights

- 🛠️ **Robot Design & Modeling**  
  Designed both mobile base and 2-axis arm using SolidWorks. Exported parts as STL and integrated using URDF/XACRO.

- 🌍 **Gazebo Simulation**  
  Launched robot in Gazebo with physics and sensors. Simulated terrain, obstacles, and real-world dimensions.

- 📡 **Sensor & Nav2 Stack Integration**  
  Added LiDAR and camera sensors to the robot. Used ROS2 Nav2 stack for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.

- 🎯 **Motion Visualization in RViz2**  
  Visualized robot movement and arm joint control in RViz2 using interactive markers and joint_state_publisher_gui.

## 🎯 Outcome

- Achieved smooth mobility and arm articulation in a virtual world.
- Built groundwork for real-time manipulation and task automation.
- Demonstrated working integration of control, sensors, and simulation in ROS2.
