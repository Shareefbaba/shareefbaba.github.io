This is Shareef Baba's home on the web!

I worked as a Project Engineer (Robotic & Mechanical Systems) at [SRM University–Andhra Pradesh](https://srmap.edu.in/), under the guidance of [Prof. P Vivekananda Shanmuganathan](https://srmap.edu.in/faculty/prof-p-vivekananda-shanmuganathan/]. During my time there, I contributed to the research project titled “Development of a Prototype Robotic System for Road Repair with a Specific Focus on Automatic Pothole Filling” where I focused on vehicle design, path planning for robotic arms, and navigation algorithms, and procurement of Components.

I earned my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Khammam Institute of Technology and Science, affiliated with [Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University](https://jntuh.ac.in/) Hyderabad, in 2023. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in robotics, automation, and autonomous systems. For my final year project, I designed and simulated a system titled “Electrical Power Generation Using Speed Breakers,” which aimed to convert kinetic energy into electricity using a crank and lever mechanism. I also achieved 5th rank in Aerospace Engineering in the [Telangana State PGECET](https://pgecet.tgche.ac.in/) 2023, which highlighted my commitment to academic excellence.

My technical skillset bridges both mechanical and software domains. I have practical experience with SolidWorks, CATIA, Arduino, and MATLAB. I'm also proficient in Python and SQL, with a strong foundation in data analysis, computer vision, and ROS2 (Robot Operating System). Additionally, I’ve trained in Gazebo simulation, sensor integration, and control systems. I'm especially passionate about autonomous vehicles, AI-based mobility, and robotic applications in agriculture and defense. I constantly seek opportunities to learn, improve, and contribute to innovative solutions in the evolving field of intelligent systems.
