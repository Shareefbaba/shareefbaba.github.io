Currently, I am working as a Project Engineer (Robotics & Mechanical Systems) at SRM University, Andhra Pradesh, under the guidance of Prof. Vivekananda Shanmuknathan. I am involved in the “Intelligent Mobility Systems for Autonomous Surveillance and Material Handling” project, where I contribute to vehicle design, path planning algorithms, and robotic arm navigation. This role enables me to apply my mechanical engineering background while working with advanced robotics, control systems, and embedded technologies, gaining hands-on experience in developing and implementing real-world autonomous robotic systems.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Khammam Institute of Technology and Science, affiliated with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad, in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I developed strong academic and research interests in the fields of mechanical engineering, robotics, and autonomous systems. As part of my final year, I successfully completed a project titled "Electrical Power Generation Using Speed Breakers," where I designed and simulated a crank and lever mechanism to convert kinetic energy into electrical energy. I also secured 5th rank in Aerospace Engineering in the Telangana State PGECET 2023, recognizing my dedication and academic strength.

My core skills span mechanical design, robotics, and embedded systems, with hands-on experience in SolidWorks, CATIA, Arduino, and MATLAB. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and have a strong grasp of data analysis, computer vision, and ROS2 (Robot Operating System). I’ve also trained in Gazebo simulation, control systems, and sensor integration. My interests lie at the intersection of autonomous systems, AI-driven mobility, and robotics in agriculture and defense. With a passion for continuous learning, I regularly explore new technologies and pursue certifications to stay updated in this rapidly evolving field.
